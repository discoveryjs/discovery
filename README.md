## Install

```
> npm install @discoveryjs/discovery
```

## Base concepts

**Model** goes through `data->prepare->render` chain. Data can be modified with `prepare` function and rendered by various views and its combinations.

**View** is a function(el, config, data, context) where:

* `el` - DOM-element in which view will be rendered
* `config` - configuration of view
* `data` - data to render
* `context` - contains of model data, metaifo (createdAt, etc), router (optional), any user defined or view defined additional data

**Page** is a root view function(el, data, context). Similar to view it has all of its arguments except config.

### Page

To define a page you should call `discovery.page.define(pageId, render(el, data, context), options)` where:

* `pageId` - unique page identifier
* `render` - page render function described above
* `options` - object with options:
    * `reuseEl` - do not clear container before render page (skiped for first render or pageId change)
    * `init` - invokes on first page render or pageId change
    * `keepScrollOffset` - dont scroll to page top if `pageId` didn't changed since last page render
    * `encodeParams`
    * `decodeParams`

Other handy methods for working with page:

* `discovery.renderPage()`
* `discovery.setPage(pageId, pageRef, renderParam)`, `discovery.setPageParams(renderParams)` triggers `renderPage()`
* `discovery.getPageContext()` gets context of page

### Special pages

There are some built-in special pages:

* `default`
* `report`
* `not-found`

You can override this pages with `page.define()` method

### View

To define new view just call `discovery.view.define(viewId, render, options)` where:
* `viewId` - unique view identifier
* `render` - function(el, config, data, context) or view definition object
* `options` - object with following fields:
    * `tag` - a tag name for a view container element. When value is `false` or `null` then `DocumentFragment` is used as a container

You can render your view with `discovery.view.render(el, view, data, context)` where:

* `view` can be string `viewId`, `ViewDefinition` or `Array<ViewDefinition>` viewId will expand to `{ view: viewId }`.
> Also you can specify `view` as `viewId:query`, that will give you handy shortcut to `{ view: viewId, data: query }`
* `viewDefinition` object with view definition settings:
    * `view`: string `viewId`
    * `when`: query, will be coerced to Boolean (but empty arrays and objects will coerce to `false`)
    * `data`: query (will be described later)
    * Also there can be view specific additional fields

### Special views

Also special built-in `sidebar` view is available you can override this view with `view.define`

### Queries

As a query you can specify string which will be processed by [Jora](https://github.com/lahmatiy/jora) so your data will be a result of following flow:

```
jora(value) -> function(data, context) -> data
```

Or you can use `function(data, context)` as query as well. Also you can use any data as query right away.
